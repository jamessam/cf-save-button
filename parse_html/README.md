This python3 script parses a `contentful space export` JSON file, finding all entries that has some HTML in it. It then creates a CSV of these entries for manual analysis.

To use this script, please replace the global variable `CF_EXPORT_FILE` on line 6 and then run with the generic `python main.py` command.
